# TRAFFIC_SIGN_RECOGNITION

Developed a CNN using Keras to classify traffic signs into 43 categories, achieving significant accuracy with
preprocessing and training over 20 epochs.
Applied dropout regularization and evaluated the modelâ€™s performance for real-time autonomous driving
applications.

The dataset used for this project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. You can download it from Kaggle:
